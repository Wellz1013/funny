        That's why I already own property, why I'm a developer at 17. I can
        go down the list. But the main reason why I work so hard is to have
        the family that I was never given and to bomb ass vacations too. 
        I know this is early for me to say things like this but I'd hate to 
        do it alone. So Ima be honestly it'll not be easy! But trust me I'll make it 
        worth while every step of the way.
